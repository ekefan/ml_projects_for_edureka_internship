    "- Longitude: A measure of how far west a house is; a higher value is farther west\n",
    "- Latitude: A measure of how far north a house is; a higher value is farther north\n",
    "- hosingMedianAge: Meduan age of a house within a block; a lower number is a newser building\n",
    "- total rooms: Total number of rooms withina block\n",
    "- total bedrooms: Total number of bedrooms within a block\n",
    "- populations: Total number of people residing within a block\n",
