# First Python data science project

## The stock Prediction Project
From this project I was able to apply concepts I learned after going through resources that<br>
introduced me to python, and data science related libraries, matplotlib, pandas, numpy and seaborn<br>

## Surpervised Learning:
I built my first machine learning model on my own ok, with some hints though, but it was cool anyway


I decided to split the problem statements into different files..

I noticed that my contributions were not being recorded on github
